I thank them and apologize if I have missed anyone.

I would like to give particular thanks to Danny Mares of Mares and Company, author of the MaresWare Suite (primarily for the "subheaders" for many of the file types here), and the people at X-Ways Forensics for their permission to incorporate their lists of file signatures.

Finally, Dr. Nicole Beebe from The University of Texas at San Antonio posted samples of more than 32 file types at the Digital Corpora, which I used for verification and additional signatures. These files were used to develop the Sceadan File Type Classifier. The file samples can be downloaded from the Digital Corpora website.
